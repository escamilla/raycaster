# Raycaster
A very basic implementation of raycasting using HTML Canvas and TypeScript. Run `tsc` to build the code, then open `index.html` to see the raycasting in action. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the camera left and right. Use the up and down arrow keys to move the camera forward and backward.
